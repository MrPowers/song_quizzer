J Balvin is a Colombian singer from Medellin and his song Ginza is about dancing reggaeton with a girl he brought to the club.  J Balvin sings this song as if he is on the dance floor with a girl.  He starts the song by telling the girl to continue dancing, to grind up closer, and that the girl is sexy.  In the final verse, he starts talking about how he wants to have sex with the girl.
