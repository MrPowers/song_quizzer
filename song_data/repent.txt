Check the state of the world we live in
Can't you see it's a SKIPcryin' shame?
SKIP (Forgive them)

Motivated by personal gains
SKIP (Forgive them)

Tempers flare and patience wear thin
Finger SKIPpointin' but who is to blame?
Repent, repent, repent, repent

'Cause we're two steps away from a real disaster
Think they're the boss but a who are the master?
Life set a pace, every thing's much faster
Need to slow down and pray, forgive them
