What do you mean? SKIPOoh
When you nod your head yes

But you SKIPwanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
SKIPOh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
SKIPOh SKIPoh SKIPoh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining

Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you SKIPwanna go to the left and you want to turn right
SKIPWanna argue all day, making love all night

First you up and you're down and then between

SKIPOh I really want to know
What do you mean? SKIPOoh

When you nod your head yes
But you SKIPwanna say no
What do you mean? Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
SKIPOh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
SKIPOh SKIPoh SKIPoh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You SKIPwanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won't let this end
First you SKIPwanna go to the left then you want to turn right
SKIPWanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down then you're between
SKIPOh I really want to know
What do you mean? SKIPOoh
When you nod your head yes
But you SKIPwanna say no
What do you mean? (SKIPoh what do you mean) Hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

SKIPOh what do you mean?
SKIP (Ooh)
Said you're running out of time
What do you mean? (ah baby)
SKIPOh SKIPoh SKIPoh what do you mean?

Better make up your mind
What do you mean? SKIPOoh
When you nod your head yes, but you SKIPwanna say no
What do you mean? (you're so confusing baby)
Hey, when you don't want me to move,
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
SKIPOh, what do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
SKIPOh SKIPoh SKIPoh what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
