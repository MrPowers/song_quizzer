I think the universe is on my side
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
Days are good and that's they way it should be

You sprinkle star dust on my pillow case
It's like a moon beam brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing SKIPooh SKIPla SKIPla SKIPlaa
You make a girl go SKIPooh SKIPooh
I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
SKIP'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright

And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing SKIPooh SKIPla SKIPla SKIPlaa
You make a girl go SKIPooh SKIPooh
I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
SKIP'Cause now I'm shining bright SKIPooh so bright
And I get lost in your eyes

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
SKIP'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
And I get lost in your eyes tonight
