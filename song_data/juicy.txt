Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to SKIPnothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was SKIPhustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just SKIPtryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter
To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm SKIPsayin'?
It's all good baby, baby, check it

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt SKIP'n' SKIPPepa and Heavy SKIPD up in the limousine
SKIPHangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, SKIPMr. SKIPMagic, SKIPMarley SKIPMarl

I let my tape rock SKIP'til my tape popped
SKIPSmokin' weed and bamboo, SKIPsippin' on private stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

Remember SKIPRappin' SKIPDuke? SKIPDuh-ha, SKIPduh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to SKIPRon SKIPG, SKIPBrucey SKIPB, SKIPKid SKIPCapri
SKIP Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky

I'm SKIPblowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know

You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with SKIPRobin SKIPLeach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke SKIPskunk with my SKIPpeeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way

The SKIPMoet and SKIPAlize keep me SKIPpissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this SKIPrappin' stuff
I was too used to SKIPpackin' SKIP***s and stuff

Now SKIPhonies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, SKIPindo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak

SKIPLivin' life without fear
SKIPPuttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school

Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know

You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, SKIPSega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur

Phone bill about two SKIPG's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is SKIPloungin'
SKIPCelebratin' every day, no more public SKIPhousin'

SKIPThinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a SKIPAc' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source

We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty

Damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know

You know very well who you are
Don't let SKIP'em hold you down, reach for the stars
(And if you don't know, now you know, you know)
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
(And if you don't know, now you know)

SKIPRepresentin' SKIPB-Town in the house
SKIP (Biggie Smalls)
SKIP Junior Mafia, Mad Flavor, uh, uh
SKIP (Bad Boy, I see you Gooch, yeah)
SKIP Aight, yeah
SKIP (Junior Mafia)

You know very well who you are
SKIP (Puff Daddy)
Don't let SKIP'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
(It's all good, Brooklyn)
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
SKIP (The Bronx, Queens, Uptown, Mt. Vernon)
(South Central, Detroit, East Side, West Side, it's all good)
